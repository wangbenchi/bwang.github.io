After working as PhD in Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and as co-PI in Zhejiang Normal University, I moved to Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation in South China Normal University in Nov, 2019. That means, our lab will be mainly located to the new institute, iBRR in SCNU at Guangzhou.

You are all welcome to visit us and/or give a talk.
