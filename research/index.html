    	<h2> Visual selection, distractor suppression, and spatial attention</h2>
    		
    	<p>When surfing the Internet, we typically try to find information that is relevant to us,
        while ignoring flashing, supposedly salient banners presented along the side of the screen
        that try to capture our attention. When banners appear consistently at specific locations
        on the screen, we seem to be better able to ignore these images. The extent to which we are
        able to control attentional selection is one of the most debated issues in visual attention
        research (Theeuwes, 2010). Some researchers have claimed that salient events that are irrelevant
        to us can capture our attention despite our best intentions (Theeuwes, 1992, 2010); however, other
	researchers have claimed that capture is always mediated by top-down control (Folk, Remington, & Johnston, 1992).</p>
		
	<p>However, in order to survive, an organism should be able to quickly adapt to a dynamically changing world.
		Humans have the ability to detect, extract and use regularities in the environment to guide current behavior.
		What we have experienced in the past, will drive our current actions. Even though this general mechanism has
		been recognized in many domains of cognitive science such as motor learning, language acquisition, and
		conditioning (e.g., Frost, Armstrong, Siegelman, & Christiansen, 2015), only recently it was made explicit
		that it may also play a role in visual selection (Awh, Belopolsky, & Theeuwes, 2012). Indeed, traditionally
		it was assumed that visual selection was the result of the interplay between voluntary, top-down, goal-driven
		selection and automatic, bottom-up, stimulus-driven selection
		(for reviews, see Burnham, 2007; Corbetta & Shulman, 2002; Theeuwes, 2010, in press).  
		However, Awh et al. pointed out that in many cases the experience with previous selection episodes
		will bias selection above and beyond top-down and bottom-up factors
		(see also Failing & Theeuwes, 2017; Theeuwes, 2018). </p>
